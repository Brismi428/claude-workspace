# Content Brief

Create a content brief and first draft for a blog post, social media campaign, or marketing asset.

## Variables

- request: $ARGUMENTS (required — describe the content, e.g., "blog post about meal planning for single parents", "LinkedIn post announcing beta results")

## Instructions

### Step 1: Context

Read these files:
- context/business-info.md — product overview
- context/strategy.md — current priorities and growth goals
- reference/brand-voice.md — voice, tone, content pillars, and writing rules
- reference/competitive-landscape.md — positioning context

### Step 2: Content Strategy Alignment

Determine:
1. **Content pillar:** Empathy & Validation (35%), Product Education (25%), Practical Tips (25%), or Community Building (15%)?
2. **Target audience:** Which persona? Sarah (divorced mom, 38), Marcus (widowed dad, 42), or broader?
3. **Channel:** Blog, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, email, or landing page?
4. **Goal:** Awareness, engagement, conversion, or retention?
5. **SEO angle:** What would parents search for that leads here?

### Step 3: Write the Brief

**For blog posts:**
- Working title (benefit-led, specific)
- Target keyword(s)
- Outline (H2s and key points under each)
- CTA, word count target, internal links to Kinroot features

**For social media:**
- Platform-specific format
- Hook (first line that stops the scroll)
- Body content, CTA, hashtag suggestions

**For landing page / marketing copy:**
- Hero headline + subheadline
- Key benefit blocks
- Social proof placement
- CTA copy and placement
- Objection handling

### Step 4: Draft

Write the full first draft, not just the brief.

**Rules:**
- Follow brand voice exactly (grounded, empowering, human)
- Use official module names (Root Planner, Kin Calendar, Mealflow, Village Network, Taskboard)
- No corporate jargon, no toxic positivity
- Specific over vague ("Plan 5 dinners in 3 minutes" not "Save time on meals")
- Reference the mental load — it is our core insight

### Step 5: Output

Save to: outputs/content-YYYY-MM-DD-{type}-{topic-slug}.md

Display a preview in the terminal and ask for feedback.
