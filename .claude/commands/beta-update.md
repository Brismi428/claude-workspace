# Beta Update

Draft a communication to Kinroot beta testers.

## Variables

- type: $ARGUMENTS (required — weekly, feedback-request, monthly-recap, milestone, or describe a custom purpose)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Context

Read these files to understand tone, current state, and recent work:
-  — who is writing
-  — latest metrics and recent work
-  — current priorities
-  — voice and tone guidelines
-  — email templates for the requested type

### Step 2: Gather Recent Changes

If this is a weekly or monthly update, ask the user:
1. What shipped this week/month? (features, fixes, improvements)
2. Any specific feedback you want to request?
3. Any blockers or delays to communicate?

If the user provides this info in the arguments, skip asking.

### Step 3: Draft

Write the email using the matching template from  as a starting structure. Adapt it to the specifics provided.

**Rules:**
- Write as Brian, not as an AI
- Match the brand voice: grounded, empowering, human
- Keep it concise — beta testers are busy parents
- Include one specific ask (feedback, action, or acknowledgment)
- Never use corporate speak or filler phrases
- Reference specific features by their official names (Root Planner, Kin Calendar, Mealflow, Village Network, Taskboard)

### Step 4: Output

Display the draft in the terminal as Subject line followed by email body.

Ask if any adjustments are needed before considering the task complete.
