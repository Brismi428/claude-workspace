# Kinroot Brand Voice Guide

## Brand Identity

## Voice Pillars

### 1. Grounded
Rooted in reality. We acknowledge the chaos without sugarcoating it. No toxic positivity, no "you've got this!" when things are objectively hard.

### 2. Empowering
Parents are capable. We don't rescue — we equip. The tone assumes competence and offers tools, not sympathy.

### 3. Human
Conversational and warm. Write like a trusted friend who also happens to be organized. Never corporate, never clinical.

- "One place for everything"
- "So you don't have to carry everything alone"

## Do NOT Say

- "Family app" — we're a single-user tool, not a family platform
- "Co-parenting tool" — we don't coordinate between adults
- "Single parents only" — we serve ALL parents carrying the load
- "Productivity app" — we're a household OS, not another todo list
- "Revolutionary" / "Life-changing" / "Game-changer" — stay grounded
- "Simple" or "easy" — parenting isn't simple; our tool reduces friction

## Writing Rules

1. **Short sentences.** Respect the reader's time and mental load.
2. **Active voice.** "Kinroot organizes your week" not "Your week is organized by Kinroot."
3. **Second person.** "You" and "your" — talk directly to the parent.
4. **No jargon.** No "synergy", "leverage", "optimize your workflow."
5. **Specific > vague.** "Plan dinner for 5 nights in 3 minutes" beats "Save time on meals."
6. **Contractions are fine.** "You'll", "we're", "it's" — keep it human.
